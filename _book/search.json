Examples include bird song, beaver tail slaps, woodpecker foraging.\nAnthrophony = sounds generated by human activity. Examples include traffic noise, sirens, fireworks, gunfire etc.\nGeophony = sounds generated by non-living earth features. Examples include wind, streamflow, and thunder.",

    "text": "1.3 Sound and digital recording of sound\nSound is propagated as a wave through a medium (air, water). When a simple sound is emitted as a pure tone, it can be depicted as a sine wave. In Figure 1.1, we see one and a half wavelengths of a simple sound wave. The height of the wave is its amplitude and determines how loud the sound is. The width of one wave is the wavelength. Low-pitched sounds have longer wavelengths than do higher pitched sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Example of a sound wave\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1.2, you can see two sound waves depicted, one in black and the other in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the two waves in the figure below has higher volume? Check for answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe black wave is louder than the blue wave because it has a higher amplitude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Example of two waves with the same wavelength but different amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitch (in music think of the note - high or low sounding) of a sound is determined by its frequency, the number of waves emitted per unit of time (typically seconds). Long waves are slower to propagate and thus have lower frequencies than do short sound waves. In other words, high-pitched sounds have a high frequency and low-pitched sounds have low frequency.\nIn Figure 1.3, we again see two sound waves. One is higher in pitch than the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the two waves in the figure below has higher pitch? Check for answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue wave is higher pitched than the black wave because it has a higher frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Example of two waves with the same amplitude but different frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVillanueva-Rivera, Luis J., Bryan C.
